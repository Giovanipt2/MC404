# MC404-Computer-Organization-and-Assembly

This repository contains all the activities developed during the **MC404 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language** course at Unicamp. The course focuses on the fundamentals of computer architecture and low-level programming using the **RISC-V 32IM** instruction set architecture.

## Topics Covered

- **Assembly Language Programming**: Syntax, instruction types, and control flow  
- **Computer Architecture**: Memory hierarchy, data paths, and control units  
- **System-Level Programming**: Registers, stack operations, function calls  
- **Peripheral Communication**: Basic I/O and interaction with memory-mapped devices  
- **RISC-V ISA**: Implementation and simulation using the 32-bit RISC-V architecture  

The repository includes source code in assembly, test cases, and detailed comments to support learning and experimentation with low-level programming.
